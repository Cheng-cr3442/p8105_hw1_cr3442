The purpose of this file is to finish p8105 homework 1 and test if I can
submit the .Rmd successfully to the Github as I am just a beginner in R.
This assignment will try to be consistent in format with a solution in
Lecture ‘Writing with data’. Now let me first deal with Problem 1.

# Problem 1

First we download a package containing the penguins dataset.

``` r
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

then we load the penguins dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Next we use inline R code to describe the data in this dataset, by using
summary() and str(). At first summary().

``` r
penguins_summary <- summary(penguins)
```

Next str().

``` r
structure_penguins <- str(penguins)
```

    ## tibble [344 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ species          : Factor w/ 3 levels "Adelie","Chinstrap",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
    ##  $ island           : Factor w/ 3 levels "Biscoe","Dream",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
    ##  $ bill_length_mm   : num [1:344] 39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...
    ##  $ bill_depth_mm    : num [1:344] 18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...
    ##  $ flipper_length_mm: int [1:344] 181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...
    ##  $ body_mass_g      : int [1:344] 3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...
    ##  $ sex              : Factor w/ 2 levels "female","male": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...
    ##  $ year             : int [1:344] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...

The we describe the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol).

``` r
# The size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
number_rows <- nrow(penguins)
number_cols <- ncol(penguins)
```

Then we calculate the mean of flipper length.

``` r
# The mean flipper length, ignoring missing value and calculate the mean
mean_flipper_length <- mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Next we make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm
(x).

``` r
library(ggplot2)

# Make a scatterplot and the color points is using the species variable inside of aes, Use na.rm = TRUE to ignore missing values
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
 
   geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x)", x = "bill_length(mm)", y = "flipper_length(mm)") 
```

Now Problem 1 is finshed already and I want to summit it to the Github.

# Problem 2

I to need create a data frame containing four different types of
variables and find the means of these variables. Finally, I need to try
to use as.numeric to force conversion of three of the variables.

First let’s create the data frame.

``` r
# Use knitr package for better table formatting
library(knitr)

# Create a data frame containing four different types of variables
df <- data.frame(
  
  numeric_sample = rnorm(10),  # A random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
 
  logical_vector = rnorm(10) > 0,  # A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  
  character_vector = letters[1:10],  # A character vector of length 10
  
  factor_vector = factor(rep(c("Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"), length.out = 10))  # A factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

  )

# Show the data frame using kable
kable(df)
```

| numeric_sample | logical_vector | character_vector | factor_vector |
|---------------:|:---------------|:-----------------|:--------------|
|      1.2630906 | TRUE           | a                | Level 1       |
|      0.5275591 | TRUE           | b                | Level 2       |
|     -1.5155548 | FALSE          | c                | Level 3       |
|      0.3099413 | FALSE          | d                | Level 1       |
|      0.3470694 | FALSE          | e                | Level 2       |
|      1.9189067 | TRUE           | f                | Level 3       |
|      0.6186565 | TRUE           | g                | Level 1       |
|     -0.5018149 | TRUE           | h                | Level 2       |
|      0.1824795 | TRUE           | i                | Level 3       |
|     -0.7597068 | TRUE           | j                | Level 1       |

Next I am going to calculate the means of these variables, the tidyverse
is already loading and I will use the pull function.

``` r
# Calculate the means of these variables,using mean(df)
mean_numeric <- mean(pull(df, numeric_sample))
mean_logical <- mean(pull(df, logical_vector))

# The two variables cannot be directly averaged, so try() is used, and silent = TRUE is used to suppress the printing of error messages
mean_character <- try(mean(pull(df, character_vector)), silent = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, character_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor <- try(mean(pull(df, factor_vector)), silent = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
# Print the results
mean_numeric
```

    ## [1] 0.2390627

``` r
mean_logical
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean_character
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

The results show that the meaning of numeric and logical works and the
meaning of character and factor doesn’t work. I will discuss why these
doesn’t work at the end of the homework.

Then I write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables and try to coerce them to
numeric, so I use numeric_xxx to represent these variables.

``` r
# Coerce variables to numeric
numeric_logical <- as.numeric(df$logical_vector)
numeric_character <- as.numeric(df$character_vector)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
numeric_factor <- as.numeric(df$factor_vector)

# Display the converted variables
numeric_logical
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1

``` r
numeric_character
```

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
numeric_factor
```

    ##  [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1

The coercion works successfully in logical_vector and factor_vector, but
doesn’t work in character_vector. I guess the reason that the coercion
doesn’t work in character_vector because character data in R are strings
and have no inherent numeric meaning, so R cannot convert them into
numbers. And it also explains why the meaning of character doesn’t work.
So how about factor? Even though factors can be coerced to numeric,
those numeric values are just integer encodings of the categories, which
have no mathematical meaning. Therefore, calculating the mean of factors
doesn’t make sense, and while R might technically allow it, the result
is not meaningful.

Finally the problem 2 is done and hence the homework 1 is finished. I
hope I make fewer mistakes.
